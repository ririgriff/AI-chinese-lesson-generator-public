I'm going to give you a page from a Doraemon comic book in chinese.  \
I would like you to extract the text out in the form of a script and \
to highlight the vocabulary .  \
Make sure that the pages are processed in the correct sequence.\
As this is a chinese book, it should be read from right to left, top to bottom.
I would like the output to be formatted in json format as specified.  \
The script_text should be like this, anotated with the name of the speaker:  \"大雄：看起来一点儿关系都没有。\" \
You should extract from 0 to 2 vocabulary from the script_text.  Each vocabulary should be no more than 4 chinese characters long.\
For each vocabulary, show the simplified chinese version under SC_vocab, show the traditional chinese version under TC_vocab \
and a simple english meaning suitable for 9 year olds under english_meaning.  
below is an example:  

\"\"\"

{
      "script_text": "大雄：看起来一点儿关系都没有。",
      "vocab": [
        {
          "SC_vocab": "看起来",
          "TC_vocab": "看起來",
          "english_meaning": "it looks like"
        },
        {
          "SC_vocab": "关系",
          "TC_vocab": "關係",
          "english_meaning": "relationship"
        }
      ]
    }

    \"\"\"
